(I'm a horrible shot I tie a horrible knot)
(I pushed a bunch of little people over once)
(Well a rest is best when you stress a test)
(And you forget all about your aching ass)
(I'm a horrible shot I tie a horrible knot)
(I muck ace a lot, I'm gonna pace the lot)
(Don't be tardy for my leaky Barbie TV party pee in the park)
Well I can't believe, you're better off alone
You stood missed own
And I can't believe, I'm better than you know
I felt the rush of no control
And it feels so good, and it feels so good, it feels so nice
Now turn your back, cause I'm coming right up on you
Turn your back, cause I'm gonna be all up on you
(Placing a bet, my odds are you and me zero)
(Being a vet, I know that you are too fearful)
(Placing a bet, my odds are you and me zero)
(We can regret, all the things we could be doing instead)
(I'm peeling into the house)
(Gotta run to the basement)
(Gotta establish a connection before I get impatient)
(I'm no contortionist man, I'll steal the lips off your eyes)
(But anyone who really matters got a call from my guy)
I can't believe, I can't believe that I can't breathe
I can't believe, I can't believe that I didn't see
See the smoke in my eyes, feel the pain in my lungs now go
See the smoke in my eyes, feel the pain in my lungs now go
(Reset this best of four I know)
(You've been waiting by the telephone I know)
(But it's not how or why I lie)
(You think I wanna be a mediocre guy)
See the cracks in my skin, feel the ground on my feet, now go
See the cracks in my skin, feel the ground on my feet, now go
I know one girl that's not gonna get home tonight
I know one girl that's not gonna get home
Heat seeking ghost of sex
Don't pay attention to my mild case of blow Tourettes
Whaaaat
I probably place a bet, took your missing tooth
There's no people left in line for your kissing booth
I always knew all of the things that you thought you think
Twice times I'll probably tell you that your gods a geek
Point and glide till your ostracized
Then pile patents on my beak cause right now its innovation week
(Innovation, innovation, innovation week)
Well I can't believe, you're better off alone
You stood missed own
And I can't believe, I'm better than you know
It feels so good
Now turn your back, cause I'm coming right up on you
Turn your back, cause I'm gonna be all up on you
(Placing a bet, my odds are you and me zero)
(Being a vet, I know that you are too fearful)
(Placing a bet, my odds are you and me zero)
(We can regret, all the things we could be doing instead)
